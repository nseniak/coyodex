"""The gate that can see a browser bug.

Every other viewer test reads `viewer.js` as TEXT and asserts on its source. That catches a renamed
function and a dropped line; it cannot catch a screen that renders wrong, a history step that lands
somewhere else, or a page that throws. Two real defects in the URL work shipped past 2104 green
tests and were caught only by a person driving a browser by hand.

This file closes that hole. It starts the real server on a real port, opens real Chromium, clicks,
and reads what is on screen. `playwright` is optional: without it the whole file skips, so a
Python-only environment still gets a clean run, the same bargain `test_viewer_js.py` makes with node.

Conventions: top-level test functions, no classes/fixtures (helpers are `make_*` / `_*`).

"""The judge layer — the SEMANTIC quality signals the deterministic profile can't see.

Two LLM-backed measures, both aggregated here into a `JudgeReport` (the artifact the comparator diffs
alongside the `MapProfile`):

  L2 grounding pass-rate — the audit already emits an L2 worklist of high-risk "actually-does" claims
    (auth surfaces, enforce/encrypt edges). A skeptic that tries to DISPROVE each claim against the
    code yields a pass-rate = fraction that survived. Reuses `audit_analysis.l2_worklist` — no new
    claim extractor.
  Rubric scores — N judges independently score each rubric dimension (faithfulness, completeness,
    drill-accuracy, altitude, golden-path) 0–4 against the code; the median per dimension tames the
    noise.

THIS MODULE IS PURE + STDLIB-ONLY. It never calls a model itself: the actual LLM work is behind the
injectable `Judge` seam (dependency injection — tests pass a deterministic fake; the Phase-4
orchestrator injects a real sub-agent-backed judge). What lives here is the SEAM, the prompt builders,
the aggregation math, and the data model — all deterministic given a `Judge`.
